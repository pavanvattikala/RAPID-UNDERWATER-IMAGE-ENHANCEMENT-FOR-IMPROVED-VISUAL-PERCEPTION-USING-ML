The purpose of this project is to provide a practical alternative that approximates the underlying solution by learning-based methods. Several models based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide state-of-the art performance in learning, to enhance perceptual image quality from a large collection of paired or unpaired data. Hence, an attempt to address these challenges is done by designing a RAPID UNDERWATER IMAGE ENHANCEMENT model and analyzing its feasibility for real-time applications. 

# Feautures
1. Enhances the given underwater image into clear image in millisecons
2. uses FUIGAN Model
3. Generates Graphs for Better Visualization
4. Simple UI for using the Model
